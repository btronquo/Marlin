# Marlin 1.1.8 - 3D Printer Firmware for CR-10 with BLTOUCH
This version is customized ONLY for Creality CR-10 printers WITH a Bl-touch sensor and octoprint (sdcard of printer disabled)
> You can find the bltouch mount here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2493610

New:
- NO SDCARD SUPPORT:
I disabled the sdcard support to avoid a bug during a compilation and save some memory ! (no choice, thanks Melzi board)
So you'll need to use octoprint to print.

- JERK / TRAVEL SPEED... settings:
I set custom optimal values for jerk setting and travel speed etc .. it's better now

## WARNING
**Do not try to upload this customized Marlin firmware on another printer than the CR-10...**


## Credits:
All Marlin credits to the Marlin Team -> https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin
All customization credits to.. me?


Have fun ! :)
