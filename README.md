# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware CR-10 version
This version is customized ONLY for Creality CR-10 printers WITH a Bl-touch sensor
> You can find the bltouch mount here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2493610

I have set optimal values in configuration.h for travel speed / jerk / print speed .. 

## WARNING
Do not try to upload this customized Marlin firmware on another printer than the CR-10...
